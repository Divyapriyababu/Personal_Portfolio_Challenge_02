## About the repository

This repository contains code for my personal portfolio page as part of University of Washington's Coding [bootcamp](https://bootcamp.uw.edu/coding/). There are two types of challenges in this course:

* On-the-job ticket or feature request challenges give a starter code in a folder called Develop, which we'll modify to complete the challenge.

* Job-seeking coding assessments or take-home assignments don't provide starter code. We'll build these from scratch.

## User story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Changes added
